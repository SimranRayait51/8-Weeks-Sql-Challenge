## üìçProblem Statement
 Danny wants to use the data to answer following Questions
  - Customers visiting Patterns.
  - Total Expenditure by Customers.
  - Customers favorite menu items.

Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.
He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program ‚Äî additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.


The data set contains the following 3 tables which you may refer to the relationship diagram below to understand the connection.
 - sales

 ## üìçChallenge and Response

__1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?__

  ***Steps Taken***
- Used a **JOIN** on `sales` and `menu` tables via `product_id` to get item prices and compute total spend per customer.
  - `sales` table contains `customer_id` and `product_id`.
  - `menu` table contains `product_id` and `price`.
- Used **SUM** to aggregate the `Total Spent` by customers.
- User **Group and Order by** to aggregate the result and order them in ascending order.
  
***Solution***
```sql
select s.customer_id ,
sum(m.price) as Total_spent
from sales s
join menu m
on
s.product_id = m.product_id
group by s.customer_id
order by total_spent asc;
```
***Output***

|customer_id|	total_spent|
|------------|-----------|
|C|	36|
|B|	74|
|A|	76|

_____________

__2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?__

  ***Steps Taken***
- Used `customer_id` and `order_date` from table `sales`.
- Used **Count** to count the `Days Visited` by customers.
- Used **Distinct** to count the unique visits as there were multiple orders.
- User **Group and Order by** to aggregate the result and order them in ascending order.
  
***Solution***
```sql
select customer_id ,
count( distinct order_date) as Days_Visited
from sales
group by customer_id
order by customer_id;
```
***Output***

|customer_id|	days_visited|
|-----|------|
|A|	4|
|B|	6|
|C	|2|

_____________

__3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?__

  ***Steps Taken***
- Used a **JOIN** between `sales` table and `menu` table.
  - `sales` table contains `customer_id` and `order_date`.
  - `menu` table contains `product_name`.
- Used **Dense_Rank()** window function in the select command - so if a customer ordered multiple items on the same first date, all are shown.( As only date is given not timestamp)
  - Partition the data by customer_id so that the ranking is done for each individual customer.
  - Order the results by order_date to ensure that the earliest order gets the rank of 1.
  - This will allow customers who ordered multiple items on the same day to receive the same rank.
- In the WHERE clause, filter the results to only include rows where rank = 1, which represents the first order for each customer.
- Retrieved the customer_id and product_name for each first purchase.
  
***Solution***
```sql
select 
summary.customer_id,
summary.product_name
from(
  select 
  s.customer_id,
  m.product_name,
  dense_rank() over
  (partition by s.customer_id order by s.order_date) As Rnk
  from sales s 
  join menu m
  on 
  s.product_id=m.product_id)
  as summary
where Rnk=1;
```
***Output***

|customer_id	|product_name|
|-----------|------------|
|A|	curry|
|A|	sushi|
|B|	curry|
|C	|ramen|
|C	|ramen|

__4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?__

  ***Steps Taken***
- Used a **JOIN** between `sales` table and `menu` table.
  - `sales` table contains `customer_id`.
  - `menu` table contains `product_name`.
- Used **Count** to count the total occurrence of the item.
- Grouped using the `product_name` and ordered by `no_of_purchase` in desc order.
- Used `Limit=1` to get only the top item.
  
***Solution***
```sql
select
 m.product_name,
 count(s.product_id) As No_of_purchase
from
 menu m
join
 sales s
on m.product_id=s.product_id
group by
 m.product_name
order by
  no_of_purchase desc 
 limit 1
```
***Output***

|product_name|	no_of_purchase|
|-----|-----|
|ramen	|8|

- Used `rn=1` to get first order purchased by the members.
  
***Solution***
```sql
select
	rm.customer_id,
    rm.order_date,
    rm.product_name
from (select 
	mem.customer_id,
