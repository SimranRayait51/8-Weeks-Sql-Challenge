## ⁉️Problem Statement
Danny wants further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner’s operations.

All datasets exist within the pizza_runner database schema are
- runners_orders
- customers_orders
- pizza_names
- pizza_recipes
- runners
- pizza_toppings

This case study is broken up  by area of focus including:
- Pizza Metrics
- Runner and Customer Experience
- Ingredient Optimisation
- Pricing and Ratings
- Bonus DML Challenges (DML = Data Manipulation Language)
But, Before we start writing our SQL queries, we want to investigate the data. We may need to handle some of the null values and adjust data types in the customer_orders and runner_orders tables.
