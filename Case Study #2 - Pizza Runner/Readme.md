## ‚ÅâÔ∏èProblem Statement
Danny wants further assistance to clean his data and apply some basic calculations so he can better direct his runners and optimise Pizza Runner‚Äôs operations.

All datasets exist within the pizza_runner database schema are
- runners_orders
- customers_orders
- pizza_names
- pizza_recipes
- runners
- pizza_toppings

This case study is broken up  by area of focus including:
- Pizza Metrics
- Runner and Customer Experience
- Ingredient Optimisation
- Pricing and Ratings
- Bonus DML Challenges (DML = Data Manipulation Language)
But, Before we start writing our SQL queries, we want to investigate the data. We may need to handle some of the null values and adjust data types in the customer_orders and runner_orders tables.

### Data Cleaning and Transformation
#### üóÉÔ∏è Table : Customer_orders
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/66a67f3d-5fb4-4fb6-a1bf-1aed39477f31)
- There is a need to clean the `exclusions` and `extra` column as they consist of **null** as a values.
- Used **Temp** table `cust_clean` because it will be stored temporary in the database and we can access it easily.
- Used **Case** statement to replace the null values with a NULL.
```sql
create temp table cust_clean as
select 
order_id,
customer_id,
pizza_id,
case
	when exclusions is null or exclusions ='null' then Null
    else exclusions
    end as exclusions,
case 
	when extras is null or extras = 'null' then NULL
    else  extras
    end as extras,
order_time
from customer_orders;

```
#### üóÉÔ∏è Table : runner_orders
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fb0749f4-6dcc-45e4-a0ca-a1e443dead93)
- There is a need to clean :
    - `pickup_time` column as it contains **null** values.
    - `distance` column as it contains **null** values and **km** in the end which will create problem will executing queries.
    - `duration` column as it contains **null** values and **min** , **mins** , **minute** , **minutes** int the end.
    - `cancellation` column as it contains **null** values.
- Used **Temp** table `runner_clean` because it will be stored temporary in the database and we can access it easily.
- Used **Case** statement to replace the null values with NULL  and also for replacing unwanted values.
```sql
create temp table runner_clean as
	select
    order_id,
    runner_id,
    case 
     when pickup_time is null or pickup_time = 'null' then NULL
     else pickup_time
    end as pickup_time
    case 
     when distance is null or distance ='null' then NUll
     when distance like '%km' then replace(distance , 'km', '')
     else distance
    end as distance,
    case 
    when duration is null or duration ='null' then NULL
    when duration like '%min'  then replace(duration ,'min','')
     when duration like '%mins'  then replace(duration ,'mins','')
     when duration like '%minute'  then replace(duration ,'minute','')
      when duration like '%minutes'  then replace(duration ,'minutes','')
    else duration
    end as duration,
    case
    when cancellation is null or cancellation ='null' then NULL
    else cancellation
    end as cancellation
from runner_orders;
  ```
#### üóÉÔ∏è Altering Data 
```sql

ALTER TABLE runner_clean
  ALTER COLUMN pickup_time TYPE timestamp USING pickup_time::timestamp,
  ALTER COLUMN distance TYPE float USING distance::float,
  ALTER COLUMN duration TYPE int USING duration::int,
  Alter column cancellation type text using cancellation::text;
```

__2. What was the average time in minutes it took for each runner to arrive at the Pizza Runner HQ to pickup the order?__

  ***Steps Taken***
- Used a **round** , **Avg()** , **exract*** , **epoch** as seconds.
- Used the difference of `pickup_time` and `order_time` to get the actual time taken by the runner to arrive at the headquater after the order was placed .
- Diveded the extracted seconds with 60 to convert into mintues.


***Solution***
```sql
select 
	r1.runner_id,
  	Round(avg(
      extract(
       epoch from (r.pickup_time - c.order_time))/60))
from
	runners r1
 join
	runner_clean r
on 
	r1.runner_id = r.runner_id
join
	cust_clean c
on r.order_id = c.order_id
group by r1.runner_id
order by r1.runner_id;

```
***Output***


| runner_id | round |
|-----------|--------|
| 1         | 16     |
| 2         | 24     |
| 3         | 10     |

__3.Is there any relationship between the number of pizzas and how long the order takes to prepare?__

  ***Steps Taken***
- Used **Subquery** to count the no of pizzas order and tho get the **average** for preparing pizza.
- Used No_of_pizza to group by and order by.
- Relation between the no of pizza and the preparation time is directly propotional as the no of pizza increases the preparation time.
***Solution***
```sql
select 
	sub.no_of_pizza,
	avg(time_taken) as time_taken
from 
	(select 
		c.order_id,
		count(c.pizza_id) as no_of_pizza,
		avg (r.pickup_time-c.order_time) as time_taken
	from
		cust_clean c
	join 
		runner_clean r
	on
		c.order_id = r.order_id
 	group by c.order_id) as sub
group by 
	no_of_pizza 
order by 
	no_of_pizza;

```
***Output***

| no_of_pizza | time_taken  |
|-------------|-------------|
| 1           | 00:12:21.4  |
| 2           | 00:18:22.5  |
| 3           | 00:29:17    |

__4.What was the average distance travelled for each customer?__

  ***Steps Taken***
- Used **avg()** on `distance` from `runner_clean` to get the average of the total distance travelled.
-  Used **Round** to round the decimal places into integer.
  

***Solution***
```sql
select 
	c.customer_id,
    round(avg(r.distance)) as distance_travelled
from
	cust_clean c
join
	runner_clean r
on
	c.order_id = r.order_id
group by
	c.customer_id
order by
 	c.customer_id;

```
***Output***

| customer_id | distance_travelled |
|-------------|--------------------|
| 101         | 20                 |
| 102         | 17                 |
| 103         | 23                 |
| 104         | 10                 |
| 105         | 25                 |



_________
__5.What was the difference between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?__

  ***Steps Taken***
- Used **min()** and **max()** on `duration` to get the diffrence .
- Used `where distance is not null` to check if the distance is not null.
  

***Solution***
```sql
select
	(max(duration) - min(duration)) as Diffrence
from 
	runner_clean
 where
 	distance is not null ;
```
***Output***

| difference |
|------------|
| 30         |



_________
__6.What was the average speed for each runner for each delivery and do you notice any trend for these values?__

  ***Steps Taken***
- Used **avg()** to get the average speed.
- Used `duration / distance *60 ` to get the speed as the duration is in minutes , multiplied by 60 to get hours.
- Danny needs to confront runner 2 as there was a significant diffrence in speed from 35km/hr to 93km/hr.
  

***Solution***
```sql
select 
	c.order_id,
	r.runner_id,
	avg(r.distance/ r.duration * 60)  as average_speed
from
	cust_clean c
join
  runner_clean r
on
	c.order_id = r.order_id
where 
	r.distance is not null
group by 
	c.order_id , r.runner_id , r.distance
order by 
	r.runner_id
```
***Output***

| order_id | runner_id | average_speed |
|----------|-----------|---------------|
| 1        | 1         | 37.5          |
| 2        | 1         | 44.44444444444444 |
| 3        | 1         | 40.2          |
| 10       | 1         | 60            |
| 4        | 2         | 35.099999999999994 |
| 7        | 2         | 60            |
| 8        | 2         | 93.6          |
| 5        | 3         | 40            |


_________

__7.What is the successful delivery percentage for each runner?__

  ***Steps Taken***
- Used **case** to sum only the delivered orders.
***Solution***
```sql
select
runner_id ,
round(100 * sum(
  case when distance is not null then 1
  else 0 end) / count(order_id),0)
from runner_clean
group by runner_id;
```
***Output***

| runner_id | delivery_percentage |
|-----------|---------------------|
| 3         | 50                  |
| 2         | 75                  |
