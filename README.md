# 🎯 8 Week SQL Challenge – My Data Adventure Begins!

Hey there! 👋</br>
This repository is my logbook through the **[8 Week SQL Challenge](https://8weeksqlchallenge.com)** by **Data With Danny** — a hands-on journey to sharpen my SQL and data analysis skills, one real-world case study at a time..

I’ve just started this challenge as part of my learning path to become a stronger SQL analyst and problem-solver. 

This repository will grow week by week as I work through each case study — solving real-world business scenarios using SQL and sharing what I learn along the way.


> 📚 Whether you're a fellow learner or just browsing — welcome aboard and feel free to follow along!
